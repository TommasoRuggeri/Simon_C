# Simon
This is the Simon game made by me with the C language. Making this game was a great way to exercise myself with the C language and with the SDL Library. To play you need to plug in a Joypad. to win the game you have to perform the same combinations of keys of the AI, if you manage to get to a combination of 10 keys without ever making a mistake you will win. The colors and the sounds will help you to memorize the combination. The four squares on the screen correspond to the 4 buttons on the controller. To play the game just plug in the joypad and double click the Simone.exe file.
